# Disconnected OpenShift Testbed

A terraform module for creating a testbed for Disconnected OpenShift clusters. It configures resources on Amazon to emulate a disconnected environment, providing the means for a user to practice or demonstrate "sneakernet" use-cases for getting OpenShift content into a disconnected environment on AWS, while still allowing for API connectivity. This is similar enough to other IPI use cases (Metal3, vSphere) that are very common on other infrastructures, as well as closely related to the experience on "disconnected" AWS overlays, to be a meaningful test bench.

### Under Construction

This README will be fully fleshed out when it is more useful.
